## Functional Programming with Swift

This demo shows how to create a simple image filter with functional programming in Swift. This is done by improving an imperative solution step-by-step:

1. [Initial imperative solution](1 - Start/)
2. [Filter using Functions](2 - Filter Functions/)
3. [Composing filters using compose functions](3 - Compose Filters/)
4. [Composing filters using compose operators](4 - Compose Operator/)
5. [Adding a new bump filter](5 - Bump Filter/)
